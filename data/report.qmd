# Introduction

This document outlines our project for STAT80B (Data Visualization). Our project will analyze homelessness data in California and the US and create visualizations based on the provided dataset.
Our project github repository can be found here.

# Our questions:
- What is the rate of increase in homelessness in Santa Cruz County from 2008-2016?
- What California county had the largest increase in homelessness from 2008-2016?
- What state had the largest increase in homelessness from 2007-2017?
- And more...

# Dataset:
- Dataset describes homelessness numbers in California counties from 2007-2017
- Data is from CalMatters Housing git repo here:
https://github.com/CalMatters/housing-viz/tree/4b49c7798ae82515e39bd7326285cc15fa8c6bd7.
- We downloaded the "data" folder from their repo to our git repo!

# Plotting Methodology
We used R to plot the CSV files from the Calmatters Housing dataset

## Plotting code

[Include excerpt of code]

# Visualization we want to reproduce
- [Insert example]

# Visualizations we've created:
Plot 1: Explanation

Plot 2: Explanation

# Challenges we've encountered
- Learning R is complicated, but rewarding!
- How will we make our visualizations more interesting using ggplot? Will we want to use additional software to create new plots?
- Aggregating the data and teaching ourselves how to create different types of plots may be a challenge

# What do we expect to achieve in the project?
- Understand trends of homelessness across our county, state, and country
- Using these trends to identify where we need change the most
- What events might have effected a DECREASE in homelessness, and what might we be able to take away from that decrease? 
- How can we continue that decrease in unsheltered homelessness in Santa Cruz County?
- The lesson at the end of our presentation: how can we improve housing affordability in our county? How can we end the housing and homelessness crisis?
